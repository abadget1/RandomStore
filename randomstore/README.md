# Random Item E-Commerce Store
### [Live Site](https://randomstore-e7f2a.web.app)


### How it works
The files are organized by components and pages. Components (by my definition) work with data, while pages are typically static with their content.

### Technologies
React.js Material-UI, Commerce.js, HTML, & Firebase hosting 

Feel free to use this software as a template for your own implementation, or however you choose to work with it.
### Enjoy!
